Issue #29: Dig Should Ensure Argument Make Sense Within the Parameters of the Environment.

The Dig command should parse incoming directional arguments and check against the hosting
environment to ensure that it makes sense within the parameters thereof for a participant
to dig in the specified direction.

If it does not make sense, then the command should provide specific messaging indicating
the reason the participant may not dig in that direction.
