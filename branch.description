Issue #35: Egg Command Should Take an Implantee's Name as an Argument

The Egg command should have, as it's first argument, the name of a participant within whom the egg shall be implanted.

If the named participant is already carrying an egg, the command should detect that condition, and respond to the
initiating participant with an error message to that effect; current egg carriers are not eligible to be implanted
in this way.
