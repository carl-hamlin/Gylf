    %define login.status                  0000h ; This status indicates that we're waiting on a username from this socket.
    %define passphrase.status             0001h ; This status indicates that we're waiting for a passphrase from this socket.
    %define active.status                 0002h ; This status indicates that the socket has been through validation and is now ready to interact with the server.
    %define set.passphrase.status         0003h ; This status indicates that the system has identified you as a new user, and is asking you to enter a passphrase with which to protect your account.

    %define new.char.sig                  0AFFh ; Indicator that the file read by address.login.status is in fact an egg, rather than an established character.

    %define dead.socket                   0000h ; Dead socket indicator. If the session file returns this value instead of a valid descriptor, the socket once held by the entry has disconnected and no longer requires polling for activity. Dead socket entries are candidates for reactivation when new connections arrive.

    %define sys.poll.in                   001h  ; 001h is what gets returned by the poll function when there's data on the socket that needs to be addressed.
    %define sys.poll.timeout              010h  ; 010h is the time to wait before assuming the socket isn't communicating.
    %define sys.poll.number.of.structures 001h  ; 001h is *always* the number of sockets to be polled in this program. We poll them one at a time to keep it simple.
