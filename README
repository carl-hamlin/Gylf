    ========================================================================

    ./build.gylf.sh

        This is the build script. It depends on the presence of nasm and ld. Run
        the build script to produce an executable binary called 'gylf' from the
        existing codebase, which it then places in the root directory.

    ========================================================================

    ./code

        The ./code directory acts as the root directory for the code implemented
        in the gylf project.

    ./code/gylf.asm

        gylf.asm is the main program - it cycles through the main loop.

    ./code/include.asm

        The include.asm file contains references to all the code contained in
        the ./code directory. This allows for selective development; we don't
        have to write all our code to one file.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ./code/commands

        The ./code/commands directory contains code pertaining to commands

        command.area.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of the
        'area' command; an administrator command that allows for administrators
        to create new areas without having to dig them out using the player
        interface.

    ./code/commands/command.broadcast.asm

        command.broadcast.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of

    ./code/commands/command.dig.asm

        command.dig.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of the
        'dig' command; a player-level command that allows for player to, under

    ./code/commands/command.egg.asm

        command.egg.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of the
        'egg' command; an administrator command that allows for the forced

        without having to go through the normal channels of fertilization
        through mating.

    ./code/commands/command.gylf.asm

        command.gylf.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of the
        'gylf' command; an administrator command that allows for the creation
        of a complete new gylf without the intervening process of mating,
        fertilization, gestation, laying, and hatching.

    ./code/commands/command.help.asm

        command.help.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of the
        'help' command; a player-level command whose sole purpose is to display
        context-sensitive help.

    ./code/commands/command.look.asm

        command.look.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of the
        'look' command; a player-level command that displays information about
        the target.

    ./code/commands/command.shutdown.asm

        commmand.shutdown.asm contains code pertinent to the implementation of
        the 'shutdown' command; an administrator command that shuts down the
        server from within the environment.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ./code/comms

        The ./code/comms directory contains code pertaining to the behind the
        scenes mechanisms surrounding communications between users.

    ./code/comms/send.to.area.asm

        send.to.area.asm contains code that sends a provided message to a
        specified area. Everyone in the specified area will receive the message.
        This code is used to facilitate communication between users in a given
        area of the environment, as well as facilitating communications between
        administrators and a given area.

    ./code/comms/send.to.world.asm

        send.to.world.asm contains code that sends a provided message to the
        entire environment. This code is used to facilitate administrator
        communications that need to be addressed to everyone in the environment.

    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ./code/functions

        The ./code/functions directory contains code pertaining to the
        background mechanisms that contribute to the overall functioning of the
        codebase. Things like writing to files, reading user input, etc... are
        all kept here.

    ./code/functions/bail.asm

        bail.asm contains code that suspends execution of the code, unloads
        from memory, and returns control to Linux.

    ./code/functions/buffer.strip.asm

        buffer.strip.asm contains code that strips buffered data of carriage
        returns and line feeds and replaces them with zeroes.

    ./code/functions/check.admin.asm

        check.admin.asm contains code that checks to see if the user on the
        current socket has administrative privileges.

    ./code/functions/check.login.asm

        check.login.asm contains code that checks to see if a user attempting
        to log in is already logged in from a different location.

    ./code/functions/clear.screen.asm

        clear.screen.asm contains code that remotely clears the user's screen
        and places their cursor in the upper left hand corner.

    ./code/functions/close.descriptor.asm

        close.descriptor.asm contains code that tells linux that we're finished
        with a descriptor, causing it to become disassociated with the dataset
        to which it currently points.

    ./code/functions/create.character.asm

        create.character.asm builds out character data on the basis of DNA
        sequences left behind by either parent on the associated egg.

    ./code/functions/create.file.asm

        create.file.asm contains code that builds a dataset on the drive, to
        which it associates a logical descriptor.

    ./code/functions/create.lock.file.asm

        create.lock.file.asm contains code that creates a lock file for use in
        preventing multiple instances of the same login from different
        locations.

    ./code/functions/dna.lab.asm

        dna.lab.asm contains code which combines the DNA left behind on an egg
        by both parents to create an entirely new gylf.

    ./code/functions/get.character.data.asm

        get.character.data.asm contains code which populates the character data
        in memory from file for the character on the current socket.

    ./code/functions/get.external.data.asm

        get.external.data.asm contains code which reads data that exists
        outside the codebase and memory.

    ./code/functions/get.ticks.asm

        get.ticks.asm contains code that returns the number of clock ticks
        since the environment was booted.

    ./code/functions/open.descriptor.asm

        open.descriptor.asm contains code that associates a logical descriptor
        with an existing dataset on disk. If the code is unable to associate a
        descriptor, it instead returns an error code, which is detectable via a
        check on the sign of eax.

    ./code/functions/poll.descriptor.asm

        poll.descriptor.asm contains code that uses a logical descriptor
        associated with a Berkely Socket to ask the socket whether or not there
        is currently data on it that requires the attention of a handler.
